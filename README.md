- SWC is an extensible Rust-based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools. It's used by tools like Next.js, Parcel, and Deno. SWC can be used for both compilation and bundling.
- This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
